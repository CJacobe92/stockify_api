Calculation for first unrealized_pl, equity and ending_balance for buy

Values:

stock price per share: 0.455
stocks to purchase: 500
starting balance: 1000

Unrealized pl calc: stocks to purchase * stock price per share
unrealized_pl: 500 * 0.455 = 227.5


Equity calc: starting balance + unrealized_pl
Equity: 1000 + 227.5 = 1227.5

Ending balance calc:  starting_balance - unrealized_pl
ending_balance: 1000 - 227.5 = 772.5

existing_equity: 1227.5
existing_unrealized_pl: 227.5

unrealized_pl: 500 * 0.455 = 227.5

portfolio_updated_unrealized_pl: existing_unrealized_pl + unrealized_pl = 455
portfolio_updated_equity: existing_unrealized_pl - portfolio_updated_unrealized_pl = 772.5
